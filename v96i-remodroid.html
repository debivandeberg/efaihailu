                            <p>It's not flyable by any means but an "observer" can use it if you're trying to spot something or to adjust lighting. Being isolated from the sunlight, you see much better the camera adjustments you need to make. You can't even "click" on anything so you still need the pilot to select the options. Oh and you need a local network. I tried using my phone as a hotspot but I couldn't get the two apps to connect together. I'm not saying it doesn't work, just that I couldn't get it to work. Maybe.  Something like teamview but just two phones. Hello friends Has anyone tried to install "Teamviewer Quicksupport" through ADB commands? link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamviewer.quicksupport.market (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamviewer.quicksupport.market) I installed it yesterday and woola! I can see the oculus screen on my cellphone and my PC through Teamviewer App, all for free. note: the battery runs out very quickly. note2: the screen is displayed in its original format looking to put an old rooted kindle to use thats running a custom rom (on android 4.4) - screen is cracked but looks perfect so i wanted to mount it in my kitchen to watch shows on, and was looking to control it from my phone. the closest thing i found was RemoDroid but it only streams a black picture and errors if i try to change the capture type to anything other than default.so anyone know of anything that could be useful in this situation. Hey guys, first thing I'm going to say is BE CAREFUL. Don't go flying your drone into buildings or trees. Don't get distracted. You will need two Android devices. 1. Get a drone if you don't have one. They're remote-controlled helicopters for those who don't know. 2. Get RemoDroid (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.im.RemoDroid). This might work with Microsoft/Chrome Remote Desktop but I've only tested it with RemoDroid. 3. Set up RemoDroid so you can control Device Hey all, I'm looking to control my MK809ii tv dongle from my HTC one M8. I'm currently using remodroid. This seems to work fine but it does make the MK lag to unbearable levels. I've downloaded every app under the suggested page and nothing seems to hit the mark. They are either windows servers or full screen grabs. I just need a trackpad style otherwise it lags to hell. Thankyou in advance. Touch stopped responding suddenly. Screen looks fine and I can still control the device via mouse. I tried remote controlling the phone using RemoDroid but through that too the touch isn't getting registered. This app works fine with other android devices. Is it possible that the digitizer is fine but the OS isn't able to register touch? I have already tried complete wipe and fresh install 
Was someone able to access the Mini via Remote? I tried Teamviewer (which I usually use between Win/Mac/iPad) and actually got a connection and was able to see the installed Apps, but the live view/remote control didn't work so far. I also tried Chrome Remote Desktop, but that only works the other way around AND only to view, not to control. Has someone else had more success? What Apps did you guys try, successfully or not? Update: This was also discussed on the Jide-Support (http://. Specifically looking for ones that allow screen streaming/control. I found remodroid but can't get my phone side to work. Any other recommendations? Edit: I do have root on both if needed. Remodroid, allows you to remotely control your Android devices on everywhere. On your Android devices you need to have the Jelly Bean 4.1+ version. </p>
