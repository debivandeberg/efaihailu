But without the need to include mainstream (and arguably worse) EPs, what's left is a solid lineup of music from rising.

With ~~no significant~~ very few albums left to release this year (barring any surprises) I think it's time for us to rank and sort how we've felt about the plethora of music that has come out in 2017. Feel free just to list your AOTY, a top 5/10/20.whatever you want. Give mini reviews of how you liked certain albums.etc. Limit it to studio releases, though if you want to shout out a live record or box set you've enjoyed or recommend that's cool. EPs are fine to sort in as well. Well, 2016 is nearly complete. And while we compile our year end lists I'd like to break from that and once again look and see what's on the docket for the next year. And what we can expect and hope to see in terms of albums for 2017. What are you eager to listen to. List bands/artists that have outright announced an upcoming album, or band that is currently writing and/or in the studio and likely to put an album out during the course of the year. --------- So far there are only 2 artist. Hello all, due to some unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances, I have to sell off some of my collection. A lot of this has been played once or twice. The items listed as VG+/VG+ are albums that have been played a handful of times and could probably pass for NM. PRICING IS BASED ON CURRENT DISCOGS PRICING. All orders have been shipped out as of 9/7/17. Still taking orders. Edit 9/8/17: More Vinyl added to bottom of list. Edit 9/13/17: More stuff being added today, prices dropped.

Radiohead were hunched over their instruments. Thom Yorke slowly beat on a grand piano, singing, eyes closed, into his microphone like he was trying to kiss around a big nose. Colin Greenwood tapped patiently on a double bass, waiting for his cue. White pearls of arena light swam over their faces. TL;DR Best newer album from an older artist. Pick an album from the past decade from an artist/band that released their debut album over 35 years ago. (1980 or earlier). You can cite new bands/supergroups if a member of that group has been recording albums for that length of time. Artists who have gone solo who's original band's debut meets the criteria are also fine. ------- My short list "Clockwork Angels" by Rush "13" by Black Sabbath "The Devil You Know" by Heaven An idea was brought to light regarding celebrating the lesser traveled and traditionally shorter releases of 2015. Demos, EPs, and Splits are certainly given less focus throughout the year and even confused for full lengths in end of the year lists. For certain styles of music and artists, the line between a demo and a full length is negligible but for others these delicate release formats represents the prologue to a wonderful story. -------- Please List Your 10-15 Favorite Demos / Splits. 
 So after writing my guide about the early South American extreme metal scene (https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/2wjkue/an_ode_to_the_south_american_extreme_metal_scene/), I figured a follow up would be inevitable. Firstly, became even though South America is not the influential beacon that it was in its heyday of the 80s, the old school resurgence has hit the continent as well and they are pumping out a ton of bands that are still faithful to the acts that made the continent so great. #June Monthly Poll - Vote Here ( , Current Results Here ( #June Releases Artist Album Label Genre Type Country ---: :--- :--: :--: :--: :--: (ghost) Everything We Touch Turns To Dust (https://n5md.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-everything-we-touch-turns-to-dust) n5MD IDM Album United States 2birds Modus ( Street Ritual Psybass, Psystep Single.
